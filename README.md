# bmi-calculator-mvc-observer
A very simple ES6 JavaScript BMI calculator built using an MVC approach with the Observer pattern.

# Project Goal
I wanted to build something simple where I could explore using the Observer pattern with JavaScript. It's not an exhaustive project at all, but it was a fun learning experience, and something I will come back to try out new approaches.
